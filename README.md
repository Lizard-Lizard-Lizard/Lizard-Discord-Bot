The ticket category should be private and only accessible to staff members. The bot will automatically set proper permissions for each ticket channel.

## Usage

### Creating Tickets

1. Users click the "Create Ticket" button in the ticket panel
2. Fill out the modal with:
   - **Title**: Brief description of the issue
   - **Message**: Detailed explanation
   - **Category**: General, Bugs, or Suggestions
3. A private channel is created with proper permissions
4. Webhook notification is sent (if configured)

### Managing Tickets

- **Staff members** can see all tickets in the private category
- **Ticket creators** can only see their own tickets
- **Close button** allows staff to close and archive tickets

### Commands

- `/setup-ticket-panel` (Admin only): Creates the ticket panel message in the configured `TICKET_PANEL_CHANNEL_ID`.
- `/delete-ticket` (Staff only): Deletes the current ticket channel after confirmation.
- `/create-transcript [user:@member]` (Staff only): Generates a transcript of the current ticket and sends it via DM. If `user` is provided, the transcript is sent to that user; otherwise it is sent to the ticket creator.
- `/ticket-summon user:@member` (Staff only): Grants the specified user access to the current ticket channel (View Channel, Send Messages, Read Message History).
